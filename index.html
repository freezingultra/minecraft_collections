            <p>A world or level is an individual Minecraft "universe" which encompasses an instance each of the Overworld, the Nether and the End. Worlds can be accessed through the world selection screen from the main menu and can be created with the "Create New World" button.</p>
        </div>
    </div>
            <h2>#1:The neather</h2>
         <p>
            <h3>Accessing</h3>
            To access the Nether, the player must construct a nether portal in the Overworld (portals created in the End do not activate). To create the portal, the player must first build a rectangular obsidian frame, ranging in size from a minimum of 4 blocks × 5 blocks to a maximum of 23 blocks × 23 blocks. Once the frame is built, it can then be activated by placing fire within the frame, using flint and steel, fire charge, dispensers or any material that is capable of igniting fire.
            The portal allows most entities (with the exception of the wither, the ender dragon, and entities riding or being ridden by another entity) to be transported to a corresponding portal in the Nether. In Survival, the player must stand in a nether portal for 4 seconds to get to the Nether. The player can step out of a portal before it completes its animation to abort the teleport. The portal plays a sound effect while the player is inside it. If there is no corresponding portal, a new 4×5 portal is created. The portal can be destroyed by breaking the obsidian frame, by a nearby explosion, or by placing water in the Overworld or lava into it with a bucket or dispenser. Any of the blocks in the corners can be destroyed without destroying the portal.
            In the former Old‌<sup>[Bedrock Edition only]</sup> world type, it is impossible to construct a nether portal. The portal block must be placed using cheats. When done, the Nether has the same 256×256 borders as the Overworld, and if a nether portal is then made in the Nether, it can spawn the player outside the world barrier.
        
            <h3>Traits</h3>
Bedrock comprises the top (including and below layer 127) and bottom 4 layers in a rough pattern, essentially making the Nether 128 blocks high unlike the Overworld's 320. In the infinite worlds of the Java and Bedrock Editions, the Nether is also horizontally infinite. In Bedrock Edition, the build limit in the Nether is 128 blocks, despite it being 256 in all other dimensions.
The Nether has no daylight cycle and no weather. Natural sources of light include fire, lava, portals, shroomlights and glowstone. Even with a light level of 0, the Nether has a dim ambient light (roughly equivalent to light level 8 in the Overworld). Light otherwise functions exactly the same as it does in the Overworld and the End.
The majority of flora in the Nether is fungus-based as opposed to plants. The Nether "grass" consists of specialized Nether mycelium (known as "nylium"). The Nether features its own unique fungi (including nether wart), as well as equivalent huge fungi which serve as trees. The stems of the huge fungi function as logs. Also present are a number of native vines and roots.
Most creatures found in the Nether are hostile and potentially dangerous.
Locations in the Nether correlate to Overworld coordinates, but horizontal Overworld distances are scaled down by a ratio of 8:1 for travel in the Nether. Therefore, traveling one block in the Nether means traveling eight blocks in the Overworld. For example, in a perfect scenario, a player who enters a portal in the Overworld at x=0, z=0 and travels in the Nether to x=1000, z=1000 returns to the Overworld at x=8000, z=8000. This makes portals a useful tool for traveling long distances in the Overworld.
         </p>
         <h2>#2:The End</h2>
         <h3>Accessing</h3>
        <p>
To access the End, the player must go through the process of finding a stronghold using eyes of ender, finding the portal room, and activating the end portal in the end portal room. The room consists of a 5×5 square of end portal frames, with the corners cut out, making a total of 12. The portal hangs over a lava pool, with a staircase leading up to it. A silverfish spawner sits on top of the staircase.
The player can activate the portal by filling the 12 end portal frames each with an eye of ender. Each frame block has a 10% chance of generating with an eye in it already, meaning the player may not necessarily use 12 eyes to activate it. Once all the eyes of ender are placed, the portal activates and emits a loud noise. As soon as it is activated, the portal destroys all blocks in the central 3×3 square, including bedrock or another portal frame, and replaces them with the end portal blocks that can teleport an entity into the End dimension. Upon jumping into the portal, the player immediately arrives in the End (x: 100, z: 0), along with any prior entities that may have teleported.
Environment
The End consists of one large island surrounded at a distance by many smaller islands, all mainly composed of end stone. There is a gap between the central island and the outer islands of about 1000 blocks with nothing but the void.
The starless sky and the void of the End are both composed of a blank, static pattern. The daylight cycle is absent in the End, similar to the Nether, being replaced by a constant dim light.
Weather cycle does not exist in the End, meaning there is no rain, snowfall or thunderstorms.

         </p>
         <p>
            <h2>The Overworld</h2>
            <h3>Creation</h3>
The Overworld is the only dimension created when the player creates a new world. The other dimensions (The Nether and The End) aren't created until a player enters the corresponding dimension for the first time.
<h3>Seeds</h3>
A new world in Minecraft is generated through the use of a randomly generated seed, which is an integer used as a starting point for the world generation formula. The player can specify a seed or allow the game to generate one randomly. If given a non-integer input (such as the word "Glacier"), the game converts it into a corresponding integer (such as 1772835215).
A given seed generates almost exactly the same world every time, provided the same edition, game version, and world type are used. Although the exact spawn point varies, the coordinates of all terrain features are the same. All seeds within the 32-bit integer limit in Java and Bedrock editions may also generate worlds with the same terrain shape and biome map, but the placement of terrain features, structures, and carver caves may differ.
<h3>Environment</h3>
The Overworld is an incredibly complex environment with a wide variety of features.
<b>biomes</b>
A river biome running through a badlands biome. A ruined portal can also be seen in the distance.
Main article: Biome
The Overworld is divided into biomes of various types. A biome's type determines the basic characteristics of the terrain within it, such as the blocks composing the surface or the plants that thrive in it. The biome type also determines which mobs can spawn within it and affects how environmental behaviors such as weather are expressed within it.
<b>Natural structures</b>
A village, one of many naturally generated structures in the Overworld.
The Overworld is composed of a large number of terrain patterns, called generated structures, whose arrangement varies widely from one seed to another. The exact structures are unique to each world, while the types of structures that can be generated at a given place are determined by the biome type. Structures are meant to represent real-world equivalents such as mountains, caves, and lakes. "Impossible" (in the real world) formations, such as floating islands, can also be found throughout the Overworld.
Along with terrain features, natural structures include naturally-generated buildings, such as villages, dungeons, mineshafts, and ruined portals.
<h3>Daylight cycle</h3>
The Overworld is the only dimension with a daylight cycle and the only one where the environment reflects the passage of time. In contrast to time zones in the real world, Overworld time is universal; it is always the same time for every player in the dimension regardless of how far apart they might be, even in an "infinite" world.
During the daytime, the sun acts as a powerful light source, with a light level of 15, the maximum. Sunlight is strong enough to grow plants and affect the way mobs spawn, among other interesting effects. During the nighttime, the moon is the only natural light source. However, moonlight is comparatively dim; the light level falls to a minimum of 4, allowing hostile mobs to spawn. Other than during thunderstorms, nighttime is the only time players may sleep in a bed.
The daylight cycle can effectively be measured using a clock, which allows players to determine the approximate Minecraft time anywhere in the Overworld. Time can also be changed or stopped with the use of the /time command.
The sun rises in the east and sets in the west, just as it does in the real world. Observing its motion is a simple method of telling direction without a compass.
<h3>Mobs</h3>
The Overworld is home to a wide variety of mobs. Mobs vary greatly in behavior and the level of danger they present to the player. Different mobs spawn at different times and places depending on the light level and the biome, among other factors. On occasion, a mob can move between the Overworld and another dimension, such as The Nether, by using a portal, but this is uncommon. Boss mobs like the ender dragon and the wither cannot enter portals.

        <h3>Collection #3:MINECRAFT tips</h3>
        <p>
            <b>1. How to Mine and Craft</b>
Minecraft
(Credit: Xbox Game Studios)
Minecraft’s namesakes are at once obtuse and elegantly simple. You must mine before you can craft, though the game’s interpretations are absurd at times. Thankfully, all current Minecraft versions include a list of recipes your character “knows” on the crafting screen, and it automatically expands as you collect relevant materials.



Beginning the game with no gear, you must punch the ground or a tree to start your journey. Once the object breaks, you’ve got your first bit of materials. Trees take longer to bust than dirt or sand, but they should be your first target. Here's how to get started.

Find a tree and slap it down.

Open your inventory. You'll see a Crafting section with a 2x2 square of inventory slots.

Place the log in any slot, and it transforms into four planks.

You can create a much-needed crafting table by placing a plank in each slot.

If you gather a bit more wood, you can whittle planks into sticks that you can use to make your first tools.

<b>2. How to Get Honeycomb in Minecraft</b>
Honeycomb is relatively easy to obtain in Minecraft, which is good. After all, it's used for many things, including making sugar that goes into potions. You can harvest it from beehives using shears once the beehive is full (you’ll notice that the beehive is full when it oozes honey). Shearing yields three honeycombs, but also angers the bees, putting you at serious risk. However, you can make a simple, safe honey/honeycomb farm by taking the following steps.

Collect three honeycombs, and arrange them in the center of your crafting table with six planks—a row above and one below—to make a beehive.

Plant flowers of any kind nearby.

Place the beehive wherever you want, but keep in mind that you’ll probably want at least two blocks of space below it.

Dig down 1-2 blocks and build a campfire. This will smoke the bees, preventing hostility.

However, the fire will harm the bees if the insects get too close. In the Minecraft Java Edition, you can carpet over the fire or use a trapdoor, blocking the flames but not the smoke. In the Minecraft Bedrock Edition, you can build a fence around the fire.

Shear when ready, or use a bottle to gather honey.



<b>3. How to Make a Map in Minecraft</b>
Maps are an essential companion for any adventurer. You simply need between eight or nine paper pieces, one redstone, and four iron ingots.

Depending upon the version, you can either place eight paper around a compass or fill the crafting table with nine paper to make a map.

If you don’t have a compass, place the redstone in the center of the crafting table with iron on its left, right, top, and bottom sides to create one.

<b>4. How to Make a Saddle in Minecraft</b>
Minecraft

Saddles are important if you want to ride a horse and move around the world a bit faster. Unfortunately, they are one of the few items you cannot make in Minecraft; you must find them. Here’s how to do so.

Saddles are most accessible through common dungeons. Simply wander the overworld, digging here and there until you find a dungeon. Once there, explore the dungeon until you find a chest. Odds are about 1:4 for finding a saddle, so it shouldn’t take long.

You can also find saddles in Nether fortresses, blacksmith chests, and even through fishing.



<b>5. How to Make Potions in Minecraft</b>
Brewing potions is a crafting sub-type that requires a brewing stand. They can be found in villages or made at a crafting table. To make a potion, you’ll need blaze powder (made from blaze rods), glass water bottles, and the proper ingredients for what you're trying to make.

With a water bottle and blaze powder, you create a base potion (typically using nether wart).

Add the main effect (e.g., regeneration potion with a Ghast Tear) by running the potion through the brewing stand again, with the new ingredient at the top and your base potions in the bottom row.

Finally, run the potion through the brew stand with glowstone dust, redstone dust, fermented spider eye, gunpowder, or dragon’s breath to create effects.

<b>6. How to Tame a Fox in Minecraft</b>
Foxes are adorable. Minecraft foxes are no different. Plus, they don’t smell like their IRL counterparts. The general process for making a vulpine buddy are similar to most other taming efforts.

First, you’ll need to find them. Foxes are nocturnal and can be found in Grove or Taiga biomes

Track one pack down, and quickly build a wall around them a couple blocks high. You must be somewhat sneaky, as foxes are skittish creatures.

With at least two foxes in your makeshift pen, you’ll need to feed them sweet or glow berries until two foxes mate and have a baby fox.

Continuing caring for the fox until it’s an adult, then you can put a lead on the fox and take it back home!



<b>7. How to Breed Axolotls in Minecraft</b>
Breeding animals is a latter-stage concern. Once you’ve graduated from scavenging basics and start harvesting animal goods en masse, such as eggs and feathers, you’ll probably want to take a few steps to get ready. For axolotls, specifically, be certain that you have plenty of accessible water. In addition, make sure to have lots of lighting in the area to keep monsters from spawning nearby and munching your pets!

With your farm set-up ready, you’ll need to first find at least two axolotls in a Lush Cave.

Capture them with a bucket, and bring them back to your farm.

Next, find tropical fish in an ocean biome.

Catch the tropical fish in a bucket.

Feed them to your Alxolotls, and they’ll enter “love mode” and soon spawn a baby.

<b>8. How to Breed Horses in Minecraft</b>
Breeding horses requires that you first tame them. This requires a saddle, and that you simply ride one until it warms up to you. It will likely buck you off a couple times, though. Stick with it, then adhere to these steps:

Once you have at least two horses tamed, bring them together in a safe pen or small, closed pasture.

You’ll need to feed the horse their favorite food to get them in the mood. In this case, that’s golden carrots (golden apples also work, but they tend to be rarer finds).

Carrots are quite common in village gardens; zombies also sometimes have them. Alternatively,  you can surround a carrot with golden nuggets in the crafting table to create golden carrots.

Feed both horses a golden carrot, and you’ll have a foal in a few seconds



<b>9. How to Make a Minecraft Server</b>
Minecraft
(Credit: Xbox Game Studios)
There are many great reasons to make and run your own Minecraft server. Fundamentally, it gives you total control over the game world. For kids playing Minecraft and parents wanting a safer digital playground, running a private server can be a great idea. Even so, it can be a pain, and unless you have a moderate level of technical home networking knowledge, Mojang recommends that Minecraft Realms, a private server subscription service, would be a better fit for most people.
If you’re running your own server, it will be Java edition; that means you must have Java installed and up-to-date. If you have trouble following the below instructions, it might be wise to look up how to use the command prompt, basic home networking (specifically port forwarding(Opens in a new window)), and how folder directories work.
Get the desired minecraft_server.1.XX.X.jar file (where the X’s will be the version number).
Create a folder with whatever name you choose, but we will call it “Minecraft Server” here.
Move the .jar file into the Minecraft Server folder and open the command prompt from the start menu.
Find the Minecraft Server in your computer’s directory.
Type “cd [.jar file’s address]” (without quotes or brackets) with the actual folder address on your PC.
Type “Java -jar [minecraft_server.1.XX.X.jar]” and hit Enter (without quotes and replacing the bracket section with the exact filename of the Minecraft Server jar file, which varies depending on exact version release).
You will see two errors. Don't worry about them.
In the Minecraft Server folder, you now have a eula.txt file. Open it, and change eula=false to eula=true. Save.
There will also be a new “server.properties” file. Open that with Notepad, and take note of the query.port setting (default 25565), because we’ll be using that in the coming steps. You can also edit other basic settings, such as difficulty and the maximum number of players.
Type “Java -jar [minecraft_server.1.XX.X.jar]” and hit enter, without quotes or brackets.
This will bring up the server window showing stats, players, and server commands.
Once you’ve done all this, Run Minecraft, go to multiplayer, add a new server, add “localhost” in the server address, and you’re set!
For other people to connect to your servcer, you’ll need the query.port setting and your public IP address (which you can get by checking “What is my public IP?” in your browser).
Give this information to new people entering your Minecraft world, followed by :25565 or whatever your query.port shows.


<b>10. How to Make Fireworks in Minecraft</b>
Real-world pyrotechnics consist of black snakes, smoke bombs, sparklers, and the like, but Minecraft’s options are limited to mini rockets that launch themselves (and potentially you) through the sky before detonating. Even so, with the right ingredients, and if you’re ambitious, a redstone system to time them, you can celebrate anything you like with enough explosives to put any July 4th or New Year’s party to shame.
Making fireworks requires a minimum of one paper and one gunpowder.
Adding up to two more gunpowder increases the pyrotechnics’ flight distance.
You can make paper by placing three sugar cane in a horizontal line on the crafting table.
Gunpowder is found by killing a creeper before it explodes.
Creating a firework star modifies the effects of the rocket.
Craft the firework star, and then add it to the paper and gunpowder when making a firework rocket.
The basic ingredients are gunpowder and matching dyes, but you can also add gold nugget, diamond, glowstone dust, fire charge, or a head block for additional effects (like a sparkling trail or a Creeper-shaped explosion).


<b>11. How to Make a Smooth Stone in Minecraft</b>
Smooth stone is one of the simplest, albeit obtuse, things to create in Minecraft. It’s an important construction material, so use these steps to whip some up.

Once you’ve got a crafting table, make a furnace with eight bits of cobblestone around an empty square.

Take the furnace, fill it with cobblestone, and add any fuel (e.g. wood, coal) you’d like.

Wait for the furnace to finish cooking, and you’ll have clean, recycled smooth stone ready to go.

                <h2>Collection #4:how to beat Minecraft and be an expert</h2>
                <h4>1</h4>1
Gather resources. When you first start a new game of Minecraft, you have nothing except a map. The first thing you want to do is gather wood. You can get wood from punching tree trunks. If there aren't any trees in the area you spawn, gather some dirt or sand blocks from the ground. Open your crafting menu and use the wood blocks to craft wooden plank blocks and sticks. You can craft wooden plank blocks and sticks without using a crafting table.
Image titled Be an Expert Minecraft Player Step 2
<h4>2</h4>
Build a shelter. A shelter can be used to protect you from hostile mobs. There are a few hostile mobs during the daytime, but most of them come out at night. A shelter is essential if you want to survive the first night. Your first shelter will most likely be temporary. Don't put too much time and effort into it. Just build a small shelter that protects you from all sides. It can be made out of wooden planks, dirt, sand or any material. When you decide on a permanent location, you can build a bigger and better shelter.
Image titled Be an Expert Minecraft Player Step 3
<h4>3</h4>
Craft tools. Tools are essential in Minecraft. To craft tools, you will first need to craft a crafting table out of 4 wooden plank blocks in your inventory. Place the crafting table and open it. Use the panel on the left to view a list of all crafting recipes. Select a tool you want to craft. You need to have the ingredients in your inventory to craft an item. Start crafting the tools you need to survive and gather more materials. You can craft tools out of sticks as well as wood, stone, iron, gold, or diamond. Weapons made of wood are the weakest and will not last long. Stone tools are stronger than wood, and iron tools are stronger than stone. Tools made of diamond are the strongest. The following are some tools you will need to craft in order to survive:
Sword: A sword can be used to fight off hostile mobs as well as slaughter animals for food.
Pickaxe: A pickaxe is used to mine stone and other minerals such as coal, iron, redstone, or diamond. Some minerals require a pickaxe made of a specific material to be mined. For example, iron ore requires a pickaxe made of stone or stronger to be mined. Diamond cannot be mined with anything less than an iron pickaxe.
Axe: An axe makes it quicker to get wood from trees and can also be used as a weapon.
Hoe: A hoe can be used to till the soil so that you can plant crops and make a garden.
Shovel: A shovel can be used to dig. If you dig far enough underground, you can find stone and other minerals. Be careful not to dig straight down. You won't be able to escape if you run into danger. Dig at an angle.
Torches: Torches are crafted from sticks and coal or charcoal. They can be placed on walls and provide light. This allows you to see at night and wards off hostile mobs.
Chest: A chest can be used to store objects from your inventory. If you die, you will drop everything in your inventory and be forced to recover everything. Use a chest to store items you don't want to lose, but don't need to carry with you.
Bed: To craft a bed, you will need some wool from sheep and some wooden plank blocks. A bed allows you to safely sleep through the night (all players need to be in their beds), as well as respawn from the last bed you slept in if you die. Place a bed in your shelter and sleep in it so that you respawn in your shelter if you die.
Furnace: Furnaces can be crafted out of cobblestone. Furnaces are used to cook food and smelt iron ore into iron blocks that can be used to make tools.
Fishing rods: Fishing rods are crafted from a stick and some string, which can be gathered from slaughtering a spider. Fishing rods can be used to catch fish, which can be used for food.
Boat: A boat is crafted form wooden plank blocks and a shovel. It can be used to safely and quickly traverse rivers and waterways.
Image titled Be an Expert Minecraft Player Step 4
<h4>4</h4>
Find food. Food is needed to survive in Minecraft. If your hunger meter is full, your health will replenish if you are injured. If your hunger meter runs out, you will start to lose health. You can get food by slaughtering animals and cooking their meat in a furnace, or by harvesting crops. You can also craft recipes from wheat, sugar cane, and other ingredients using a crafting table.
Image titled Be an Expert Minecraft Player Step 5
<h4>5</h4>
Explore. Exploration is one of the most fun aspects of Minecraft. When you start a new game of Minecraft, a map is the only thing you are given. Use the map to explore the world. The map will fill out the more you explore the world. Take note of anything of interest. This can include caves, villages, new biomes, or structures, or temples.
Be careful not to lose your map. If you drop your map and lose it, you will need to craft a new one and start over again.
Be careful not to wander too far from your shelter. Minecraft worlds are randomly generated and are virtually infinite in size. It's very easy to get lost in Minecraft.
Keep note of your shelter’s coordinates by pressing the “fn” and “f3” keys together so you’ll know which direction to go if you get lost.

Set up a permanent home base. After you have explored the world a little bit, find a location to set up your permanent base. It should be an area with plenty of resources nearby. This could be near a village, or a large cave system, or in a rich biome such as a forest, jungles, or mountains. Once you find a suitable location, start constructing your permanent shelter. It can be constructed out of any material you want. The stronger the material, the better. It should be large enough to house your bed, several chests, a crafting table, furnace, and any other useful tools you want to use (anvil, brewing station, enchantment table). You may also want to take some time to add some decorations to your permanent home.

Go mining. Mining is how you find some of the most valuable resources in Minecraft. This includes iron ore, redstone, gold ore, emerald, diamond, and more. The easiest way to mine is to find a cave and explore it. You can also dig your own mine with a shovel. Bring a stone or an iron pickaxe (preferably iron). Use the pickaxe to mine minerals from the stone blocks that have colored spots on them. Different colored spots correspond to different minerals.
Blocks with black spots contain coal. Blocks with light yellow spots contain iron ore. Blocks with dark yellow spots contain gold ore. Blocks with light blue spots contain diamond. Blocks with green spots contain emerald. Blocks with dark blue spots contain lapis lazuli.
Be careful. Caves are especially treacherous. They are full of hostile mobs, lava, and deadly drops. Don't bring anything into a cave that you don't need. It's also very easy to get lost in caves. You may even want to place a chest at the cave entrance to store your findings and things you want to keep.
Bring lots of torches. Placing torches not only helps illuminate your path, but they can also act as breadcrumbs to help you find your way out of the cave. Be sure to collect the torches on your way out.
Be careful around lava. With the exception of netherite, any items dropped in lava will not be recoverable.
Obsidian is the hardest material in the game. Obsidian is formed with still lava touches still water. It can often be found in caves It requires a diamond pickaxe to mine.

Craft armor. Armor is used to provide a little more protection. It can be crafted out of leather (from slaughtering cows), chainmail, iron, gold, or diamond using a crafting table. Armor consists of four pieces: a helmet, chest piece, pants, and shoes. Craft each piece individually and equip them in the inventory.

Build farms. One way to create a continuous supply of resources is to build farms. Gardens can be used to plant and grow crops. This provides you with an endless supply of wheat, carrots, potatoes, beetroot, pumpkins, melons, and more. You can also farm animals in Minecraft. Use fences to keep them enclosed and feed them to make them want to breed. When you have enough, you can slaughter them for meat or materials.

Tame animals. There are many animals that you can tame in Minecraft. Horses and mules can be ridden when tamed. Llamas and mules can be used to transport chests. Wolves can be used as hunting partners. Cats can be used to keep creepers away. Use the following steps to tame animals in Minecraft:
Horses, Mules, Llamas: You can tame horses, mules, and llamas by attempting to mount them repeatedly. When they stop bucking you off and show hearts over their head, they have been tamed. You can craft a lead to walk them. Horses and mules must have a saddle equipped in order to ride them.
Dogs/Wolves: Collect bones that are dropped when you kill skeleton archers. Give them to wolves to tame them. When hearts appear over their head and it's collar turns red, it has been tamed.
Cats: Cats hang around villages. Give cats raw fish in order to tame them. When hearts appear over their head, they have been tamed.

Learn enchantments. Enchantments are a way for you to add bonuses and perks to your tools, weapons, and armor. You first need to craft an enchantment table from diamond, obsidian blocks, and a book. You can then use the enchanting table to make enchanted books. Then you need to craft an anvil out of three iron blocks and four iron bars. Use the anvil to make enchanted tools, weapons, and armor using your enchanted books.

Explore the Nether. In Minecraft, the Nether is a Hell-like dimension that is full of fire, lava, and many hostile mobs that can't be found in the regular Minecraft overworld. You can also find many minerals and materials that can't be found in the Minecraft overworld. Many of the ingredients needed to make potions can only be found in the Nether. To get to the Nether, you need to build a Nether portal out of obsidian blocks and then light it on fire using flint and steel. Then you can pass through the Nether portal to get the Nether and back again.

<h4>13</h4>
Learn to make potions. Potions can be used to add temporary status effects to you, mobs, or other players. Some effects are positive. Some are negative. Some potions can be consumed. Other potions can be thrown. To make potions, you first need to craft a brewing stand from cobblestone and a Blaze rod (found in the Nether). Then you need to craft a bottle out of glass. Then you can make potions from various ingredients and a glass bottle.

<h4>14</h4>
Beat Minecraft. For the most part, Minecraft is an open-ended game that never really ends. Many people aren't aware that it is actually possible to beat Minecraft. If you've mastered everything else Minecraft has to offer, you can craft an Eye of Ender and use it to find an Ender portal. Once you find one, place an Eye of Ender on each of the pedestals to activate the Ender portal. Pass through the Portal to reach the End. From there, you will need to slay the Ender Dragon to beat Minecraft. This is not an easy task, but if you can beat the Ender Dragon without cheating or switching to Creative mode, you are truly an expert at Minecraft.

            <h2>Collection #5:How to be a Expert at building</h2>
            <h4>1</h4>
Practice building in Creative Mode. Creative mode gives you an infinite supply of all blocks and resources. You don't have to worry about finding resources and crafting anything. Building a complex structure in Survival mode is an arduous task that takes forever. Use Creative Mode to make things easier.
You will not be able to earn any achievements or trophies in Creative mode. Achievements and trophies will be disabled on a Survival mode game once it has been switched to Creative mode or cheats are activated. Be sure to keep your Survival mode games and Creative mode games as separate save files.
When you create a new game in Minecraft, you have the option to make a Flat World under "World Type" in the Game Settings menu. This creates a flat world with no trees, water, hills, mountains, or caves. You may want to consider creating a flat world when building structures. That way you don't have to worry about landscaping before you start building.

<h4>2</h4>
Study other people's builds. One way to get ideas and inspiration for a new Minecraft build is to look at builds that other people have made. Download maps made by other people, as well as look at photos and YouTube videos online. Take note of the color scheme they use, what types of blocks they use and where. Pay attention to how roofs, pillars, and furniture are constructed. See what types of blocks are used to make different shapes and designs. Check out how lighting is used. Build up a collection of reference material for your own builds.

<h4>3</h4>
Make a sketch or model of your build. Before you start making an elaborate Minecraft build, it's a good idea to sketch your ideas on paper or build a model of them. You can use isometric paper to draw a 3D model of your build on paper. You can also use 3D modeling software, such as Google SketchUp, Blender 3D, or TinkerCAD to create a rough model of your structure.
Image titled Be an Expert Minecraft Player Step 18
<h4>4</h4>
Decide on a color scheme. Think about what colors you want your structure to have before you start building. It's a good idea to have a few complimentary colors and one contrasting color. For example, you may decide to make the walls a brick-red color with maybe some light shades of red here and there. Then you may want to make the roof an aqua-blue color or emerald green to contrast with the red. [1]

<h4>5</h4>
Use basic blocks to build the bulk shape of your structures. When you first start making a structure, start with basic blocks that have bright colors. Use them to build the basic shape of your structure. Don't worry about adding slabs, stairs, or details just yet. Just build the bulk of the structure using basic blocks to get a feel of the shape and scale. You can add details later.

<h4>6</h4>
Break down larger shapes into smaller shapes. For example, if you are building a mansion, you may start by building a huge rectangle that is the size you want the mansion to be. Then you may want to add a smaller rectangle to the front where you want the entranceway to go. Then you may want to cut out or add another smaller rectangle on both sides where you want window wells to go. Then you may decide you want to create a diagonal shape around the corners of the roof or foundation. Then maybe you'll want to finish by adding some trim around all the edges. Then you can add a separate roof on top of all your rectangle shapes to get a complex roof shape. [2]

<h4>7</h4>
Use a variety of blocks on your builds. Don't just use a single block type such as cobblestone, wooden planks, or brinks for all the walls on your build. Keep the color scheme complimentary, but use a variety of blocks with different textures that contrast with each other. If you are using cobblestone, you may want to use some smooth stone around the doors and windows or in between layers. Use a different color block for the roof and/or trim. Add some depth to your walls too. Don't just make each side a flat surface. Add some trim around the edges or windows. Add arches around doors or window seal below windows.

<h4>8</h4>
Use rows and columns of blocks to get different roof angles. It's easy to create a roof that is at a 45-degree angle by making blocks that staircase up 1 block at a time. You can make shallower angles by making blocks that staircase after rows or two or three. You can also make steeper angles by making blocks that staircase after columns or two or three. You can also use slabs and stair pieces to adjust the angle of a roof.
Image titled Be an Expert Minecraft Player Step 23
<h4>9</h4>
Use stairs, slabs, fences, and trap doors in creative ways. You don't have to use stair pieces just to make stairs. For example, you can place upside-down stair pieces to make a countertop or table. A trap door or pressure plate can also be used as a tabletop You can also use trapdoors to make window shutters or the armrests of a chair. You can add slabs to add an overhang below a roof or adjust the angle of a roof. You can use slabs and slabs placed at different angles to create all kinds of unique patterns. You can also stack fence posts to make a pole or create a hanging chandelier. You can make a chair by placing a single stair piece with two trap doors on both sides.

<h4>10</h4>
Learn redstone mechanics. In Minecraft, redstone works as a source of electricity or power. It can be used to make all kinds of mechanical contraptions. You can use redstone to make automatic lights and automatic doors. You can also make an elevator, or a drawbridge. There are all kinds of mechanisms you can make with redstone in Minecraft. People have even used redstone to build a functioning computer inside Minecraft.
